== Description ==

[Vesta](https://trustvesta.com/) Corporation is a global provider of fraud and payment solutions for online commerce. Founded in 1995, Vesta began as a pioneer in processing fully guaranteed transactions in the global telecom sector. Since then, the company has steadily expanded its solutions and solidified its position as the leader in guaranteed digital payments for electronic delivery, physical delivery and pickup in-store. Vesta's flexible and scalable solutions enable merchants to eliminate fraud and increase revenue by delivering secure, frictionless transactions that maximize acceptance and improve the customer experience, all backed by a zero-fraud-liability guarantee.

The Vesta Guaranteed Payment extension for WooCommerce allows you to accept credit and debit card payments directly on your WooCommerce store. With Vesta Guaranteed Payments, customers stay on your store during checkout instead of being redirected to an externally hosted checkout page.

**Vesta Payment Extension and PCI:**
We employ the industry's best security practices and tools to maintain bank-level security for merchants and end customers. Vesta is PCI DSS Level I and GDPR compliant. Our extension utilizes the WooCommerce UI which allows you to preserve the design of your website while using Vesta's input fields to facilitate secure and encrypted transaction processing capabilities. The PCI compliance burden for merchants is reduced because the transaction takes place on the Vesta Payment gateway, no confidential card data is ever stored on your (or WooCommerce's) servers and tokenization is always utilized when customer payment details are stored on Vesta's servers.

**Third-Party Agents or Service Providers.**
Vesta may transfer Personal Data to our third-party agents or service providers who perform functions on our behalf as described in our[Website Privacy Policy](https://trustvesta.com/legal/privacy-policy/). Our [Service]( https://fingerprint.ecustomerpayments.com) utilizes device fingerprinting from [ThreatMetrix]( https://www.threatmetrix.com/privacy-policy/) which allows our risk team to conduct real-time monitoring by detecting transaction and device anomalies and by enabling detection of the transaction’s originating-device IP address. Device fingerprinting is required for all Web transactions and the implementation is only on the checkout/payment page. Where required by the Privacy Shield, we enter into written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection the Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process Personal Data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of Personal Data that we transfer to them.

Vesta's Data Collector product allows our risk team to capture and analyze user behavior on your website. This data is leveraged in real-time transaction risk decisions to both decrease fraud and increase acceptance rates. Implementation of this service follows the entire customer journey, from the first landing page, through registration, shopping and checkout/payment pages.
